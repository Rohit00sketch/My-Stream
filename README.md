# My-Stream
Movie hosting website

I've created a simple, Netflix/Prime Video-like website for watching movies!

This website features:

A dark, modern interface with a prominent header, search bar, and navigation.

A featured movie section at the top.

Dynamically loaded movie listings organized into horizontal, scrollable categories (e.g., "Action & Adventure," "Comedy," "Thriller").

Interactive movie cards with thumbnails, titles, and descriptions.

A functional video player that appears in a modal when you click "Play" on any movie card or the featured section.

A search bar that allows you to filter movies by title, description, or genre.

Responsive design to ensure it looks good on various devices.

Important Note: For demonstration purposes, all videos on this website will play a royalty-free clip (Big Buck Bunny). This is because I cannot host actual movie content due to copyright and storage limitations. You'll see a note in the video player modal indicating this.
